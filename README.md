Yolo-V9 for Orange Disease Detection:

YOLO-V9 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that has been widely used in various applications,
including plant disease detection. Orange disease detection is a crucial task in citrus production, as early
detection can significantly reduce crop loss and improve fruit quality. YOLO-V9's robust performance and real-time 
processing capabilities make it an attractive choice for detecting various orange diseases, such as citrus canker,
greening, and melanose. Researchers have successfully utilized YOLO-V9 to detect these diseases using computer
vision and deep learning techniques.
